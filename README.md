Simple responsive *HTML* page, I added some responsivity to the *HTML* page with *CSS* to support screens less than ***1024*px** width.<br />
But the navbar is not fully responsive for smallest screens.
Here it is for desktop screens :

And here it is how it displays in **narrower** screens (< ***1024*px**) :
